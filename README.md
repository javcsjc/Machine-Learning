# Machine-Learning
Final Practical Machine Learning Project

In this project, my goal is to use data from the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise.
 
For more information about the dataset go to: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl. The effectiveness of each repetition was classified in five different classes: 

1. Exactly according to the specification (Class A)
2. Throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
3. Lifting lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
4. Lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D), and
5. Throwing the hips to the front (Class E). 

Class A corresponds to an exercise performed correctly, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. 

Participants were wearing 4 accelerometers to measure exercise effectiveness. These were located on the belt, forearm and arm of the participants + one to measure position and acceleration on the dumbbell.
